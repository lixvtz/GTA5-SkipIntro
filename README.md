# GTA5-SkipIntro

Another inefficient way to bypass GTA5 intro video. By replacing the original `rockstar_logos.bik` with this file, you can skip the intro step after seeing just one frame of the video.

3. Back up the original `rockstar_logos.bik` file (optional but recommended).

In this video:

1. Vanilla GTA5:

Duration: Approximately 60.23 seconds.

The original intro sequence includes multiple logos and animations, significantly delaying the time to access the game.



2. SkipIntro + ReKReation 1.5:

Duration: Approximately 43.14 seconds.

With the provided rockstar_logos.bik file, the intro is reduced to a single frame, effectively skipping the sequence almost instantly.

This modification drastically reduces the time to start playing the game, saving you 17 seconds of waiting time each launch.
